# Chained-K-Nearest-Neighbour
Chained_K_Nearest_Neighbour algorithm
An epidemic is breaking out in a region containing M cities, and quarantine partitions are needed based on the likely spread of the disease.  You are asked to write a program that clusters the cities into K clusters (with K being a variable parameter indicating the number of quarantined partitions) such that if a city is closest to some other city, then those cities are part of the same quarantine group.

Using Euclidean distance as a measure of closeness between points, the following cities would be clustered as follows (with varying K)â€¦
Input:
The number of cities (ie. M)
M city names and their locations on an x1 vs. x2 axis (data provided via stdin)
various values for K to compute clusters for (also via stdin)

Output:
cluster assignments for each value of K



Example:

	input:
		hw6_sample_input.txt
the first number is represents M (the number of data points)
the next M non-empty lines represent the M data points [name x1 x2]
each number that follows is a value of K to compute clusters for
output:
K=2
	Cluster 1: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L
	Cluster 2: M, N, O
K=3
	Cluster 1: A, B, C, D
	Cluster 2: E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L
	Cluster 3: M, N, O
K=4
	Cluster 1: A, B, C, D
	Cluster 2: E, F, G, H
Cluster 3: I, J, K, L
	Cluster 4: M, N, O

	
*Note: the points assigned to the same cluster must be as shown above, however the cluster numbers assigned to each cluster can be different
