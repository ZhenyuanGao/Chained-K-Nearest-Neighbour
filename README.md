# Chained-K-Nearest-Neighbour
Chained_K_Nearest_Neighbour algorithm
An epidemic is breaking out in a region containing M cities, and quarantine partitions are needed based on the likely spread of the disease.  You are asked to write a program that clusters the cities into K clusters (with K being a variable parameter indicating the number of quarantined partitions) such that if a city is closest to some other city, then those cities are part of the same quarantine group.

Using Euclidean distance as a measure of closeness between points, the following cities would be clustered as follows (with varying K)â€¦
